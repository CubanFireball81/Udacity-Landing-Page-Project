#Landing-Page-Project

My name is Alejandro Santiago and this is my submission for the Udacity Landing Page project, details below. MY project is live on Netlify here: https://cubanfireball81-udacity-landing-page-project.netlify.app/

Please take a moment to check out my project and offer feedback and suggestions on ways to make it better. 


Landing Page:

This project required me to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page, as well as have a fully responsive design (to include a menu that highlights the section being viewed).

Within my project, I used Upsplash photos and verbiage from Apple's website to tie my project to the real world. I tried my best to keep with the space theme, since the background photo is one of Apple iPad's wallpaper.
