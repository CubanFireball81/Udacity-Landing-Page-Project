# Udacity-Landing-Page-Project


Landing Page:

This project requires you to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

This project aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. The functionality you will be using serves two purposes: to prepare you for appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show you how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site. This project barely touches the surface of what is possible, but it does use some incredibly common events, methods, and logic.

What will I learn?

The landing page presents the first opportunity to fully combine your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a large project. Aside from solidifying your skills with these three technologies, youâ€™ll discover how best to combine them in a complex application.

All information in this ReadMe belong to Udacity. I have included the information here since Udacity did a great job explaining the project and why it is being done. 

Within my project, I used Upsplash photos and verbiage from Apple's website to tie my project into real life. I tried my best to keep with the space theme, since the background photo is one of Apple iPad's wallpaper.
